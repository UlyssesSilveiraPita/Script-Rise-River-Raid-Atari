# Script-Rise-River-Raid-Atari
A remake of the Atari classic River Raid, recreated in Unity.  Control your plane, dodge enemies, destroy targets, and collect fuel to survive. A tribute to the original game, with reworked gameplay, smooth physics, and a modern interface.

✈️ Retro nostalgia with modern programming!

I developed a remake of River Raid (Atari) in Unity, bringing back the excitement of the classic, but with smooth physics, refined controls, and a dynamic fuel system.

This project was part of my C# learning curve for games, exploring:
<br>
✅ Player input (movement and shooting)
<br>
✅ Infinite scrolling level mechanics
<br>
✅ Real-time fuel system
<br>
✅ Coroutines for death animations
<br>
✅ HUD with fuel bar and score

This is just the beginning — I'm recreating other Atari classics as part of my Game Developer portfolio 🎮
